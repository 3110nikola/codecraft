# Codecraft

Codecraft is a front-end project representing a fictional website company. This website was created as part of my learning process using, primarily, React + ViteJS and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a showcase of my coding skills and knowledge.

## Disclaimer

Codecraft takes inspiration from Eight25 (https://www.eight25media.com/) and includes some content, such as texts and design elements, for educational purposes. The content used from Eight25 belongs to their respective owners, and I do not claim ownership of it.

Please note that the contact form functionality in this demo may not be fully executable as it relies on sensitive information stored in a .env file, which is not uploaded for security reasons. The project is intended to demonstrate coding skills and will not have full interactivity without the proper configuration of the .env variables.
