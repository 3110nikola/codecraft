          <p>Credibility creates trust. Trust drives action.</p>
          <p>
            But many high-growth companies can often be singularly focused on
            their product and technology–they leave brand credibility as an
            afterthought. And no matter what you say about your product —if your
            brand isn't credible — you will not be considered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forward-thinking companies make smart investments to protect their
            brand credibility because the stakes are high.Studies show that
            visitors to your website can make a decision whether to stay or
            leave in just 50 milliseconds (50ms).
          </p>
          <img src="/stay-or-leave.jpg" />
          <p>They’re not making that decision in the blink of an eye.</p>
          <p>They’re making the decision in ⅓ the blink of an eye.</p>
          <p>
            Certainly, no small part of that lightning-quick decision-making
            process is powered by the perception of credibility that’s displayed
            (or not displayed) on the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, we also know that purchase decisions are also driven by
            credibility. Consumer research has found that improved confidence is
            correlated with nearly a 50% increase in purchasing behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            These findings apply equally for companies selling clothing and
            companies selling $1 million tech infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-secondary text-sm">
            In other words, credibility shapes perception and drives revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s where many tech companies are falling short on their brand.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">The Brand Credibility Gap</h1>
          <p>
            Credibility is valuable specifically because it’s difficult to fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have credibility, it signals to potential customers that
            you’re trustworthy but also that you’re stable, reliable, and
            predictable (safe choice).
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a credible brand means your customers know what to expect and
            expect to receive what they need. Your brand needs to convey that
            you know their pain point inside and out, and that when they call
            you, that pain goes away.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially for startups and growing tech companies looking to sell
            into enterprise accounts, your brand’s reputation will be under
            heavy scrutiny. And for good reason, with 90% of technology
            companies ultimately failing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fortune-500 customer you want to sign a 3-year contract needs to
            know how long you’ll be around and that you won’t radically pivot in
            the next 2 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know you have a credibility issue when your sales team hears
            questions like:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 marker:text-yellow-400">
            <li>Which companies have you worked with?</li>
            <li>Do you have experience in MY specific industry?</li>
            <li>When did you raise funding last?</li>
            <li>How much have you raised?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is called the <b>Credibility Gap</b>, and it’s the
            responsibility of marketers to overcome.
          </p>
          <img src="/credibility.jpg" />
          <p>
            Your job as a marketing leader is to identify when, where, and how
            customers are assessing your credibility and then being proactive,
            deliberate, and strategic about how you build brand trust across
            your marketing mix.
          </p>
          <p>So how do you know if you're doing it right?</p>
          <p>
            The story, design, and technology of your website send strong
            signals about your brand’s credibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s where most prospective customers first interact with your
            company, or it’s the first place they look for more information
            after they’ve learned about your products.
          </p>
          <p>
            But before we look at exactly how your brand can be damaging your
            credibility, let’s start by unpacking how we – as humans and as
            customers – perceive credibility.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">
            A Framework for Understanding Digital Credibility
          </h1>
          <p>
            Let’s look at the core components of trust. Then we can see what
            levers and strategies should be part of our playbook for creating
            trust and closing the <b>Credibility Gap</b>.
          </p>
          <img src="/credibility2.jpg" />
          <p>
            A seminal study from Stanford’s Persuasive Technology Lab found that
            credibility–specifically in the digital space–is constructed of four
            key components.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-decimal ml-5 marker:text-yellow-400">
            <li>
              <b>Presumed credibility</b> - Industry, verical, product
              categories, and brand strategy
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reputed credibility</b> - Social proof, social media, reviews,
              testimonials
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Surface credibility</b> - Design, UX, messaging, content
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Experienced credibility</b> - Product quality, service
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Looking at each facet, we can understand both the role of brand
            credibility in the buyer’s journey and which strategies and channels
            are related to each.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">
            Being Strategic About Building Trust with your Website
          </h1>
          <p>
            Nearly every company’s website experiences some of these challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, these problems don’t happen in a vacuum and they’re not
            tactical hiccups that you can fix in a day by adding a logo bar to
            your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brand credibility problem is the product of a broken process for
            designing and building websites that doesn’t consider credibility at
            a <i>strategic level</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Codecraft, our playbook is built around strategy. As a central
            part of that strategy, we assess, understand, and build brand
            credibility into our entire process, from storytelling to design to
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four key steps in our process that help us align around
            building credibility and reinforcing the brand narrative as a
            central piece of the website strategy.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">1. Identify the gaps</h1>
          <p>Credibility is cultivated through consistency.</p>
          <p>
            If your messaging and positioning are inconsistent or don’t align
            with how you’re already perceived by potential customers, then you
            create confusion.
          </p>
          <img src="/gap.jpg" />
          <p>
            During our discovery process, we dig deep into understanding your
            ideal positioning–the perception that you want to exist–and the gaps
            that exist in both your current marketing strategy and in
            conversations you’re having with potential customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helps us define clear gaps in your strategy that we can address
            in our messaging hierarchy.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">2. Align the messaging hierarchy</h1>
          <p>
            Once we understand the gaps, we can develop a framework to address
            those inconsistencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build a unified communication and messaging strategy that’s
            rooted in the brand strategy and aligns your business with your
            buyers.
          </p>
          <img src="/communication.jpg" />
          <p>
            This helps us close the gap and make sure that all of our key
            communications and key messages are anchored by the overall brand
            and business strategy.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">3. Mapping the page-level journey</h1>
          <p>
            Before we delve into wireframing and design, we want to overlay the
            messaging strategy that we developed above with the specific pages
            on the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with a single page – like the homepage – we use our
            messaging hierarchy to construct a journey that informs how the
            content itself should be structured.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">4. Define the site-level journey</h1>
          <p>
            Finally, we create a <b>Journey Deck</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This resource extrapolates our messaging strategy across the
            customer journey to encompass all of the relevant pages on your
            site, building a framework for how your ideal customer profiles will
            move through the site and how we will build and maintain
            credibility.
          </p>
          <img src="/how-what-why.jpg" />
          <p>
            Using this framework, we can identify opportunities to bridge the
            Credibility Gap using strategic elements like social proof, case
            studies, and content that establishes your brand as a thought
            leader.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-2xl">
            Maximizing Brand Credibility in your Website
          </h1>
          <p>
            For over 10 years, we’ve been honing and crafting our playbook.
            We’ve looked at traditional approaches to site design and developed
            a modern, smarter approach to driving business results.
          </p>
          <p>
            A high-quality website is table stakes. But not all sites are built
            equally.
          </p>
          <p>A strategic website delivers results:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 marker:text-yellow-400">
            <li>40% increase in revenue</li>
            <li>37% drop in bounce rate</li>
            <li>81% traffic increase year-over-year</li>
            <li>2x conversions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We understand your brand’s credibility is hard-won and fragile. We
            know what's at stake. We understand that CMOs (marketing leaders)
            live and die by brand credibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why we use proven frameworks to protect–and improve–one of
            your most critical business assets.
